bonjour, hallo, hey, ciao :) 

Web enthusiast with a passion for building things. Serial entrepreneur with 3 companies founded in the last 4 years. Tens of pivots and plenty of failures along the way, I am decidedly driven and fabulously ambitious.

My specialisation is in front-end development coupled with a good eye for design and proficient knowledge of how users interact with interfaces (UX).

I pride myself on writing code that is easy to read, understand and communicate. I'm a big fan of the Unix philosophy and believe that code should be modular, reusable and easy to test.

Born and bred Londoner, currently based in Berlin.

I like to play football, read fantasy and history novels, support Crystal Palace and travel the world. I love to eat Italian, Indian and Lebanese food.

Some of my favourite books include: A Storm of Swords, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, The Lord of the Rings, All Quiet on the Western Front, Jane Eyre, The Road, The Shining, The Forgotten Soldier.

Currently building [lingly](https://www.lingly.ai), [workauto](https://www.workauto.co.uk) and [Forward Digital](https://www.forwardigital.co.uk).
